# INFO

![](https://github.com/wiktornowicki/crystal_npp/blob/master/crystal_bg.png)

This repository will contain only the Crystal theme for Notepad++ and will be occasionally updated. Besides that, it might be converted into a light theme (as an external file).

For the list of supported languages, refer to the initial comment doc in the Crystal.xml file.

## Other supported languages:
	:: F#;
	:: ModScript;
	:: Visual Basic .NET.

## People to be credited:
	:: Kaczo24 - for creation of ModScript and helping me out with the custom language design;
	:: Notepad++ dev(s) - for creation of this amazing tool;
	:: IDK who created the custom F# language, but if you know, give 'em some love as well (this is credit for the previous version, current one has been created by me);
	:: and, of course, you - for using some weird teen's pastel-coloured theme! Thank you all so much!
	
This project is absolutely open-source, just like N++ itself. Feel free to tamper with all this, however I'd prefer if you forked the repo. I really don't feel like fixing your mess.
